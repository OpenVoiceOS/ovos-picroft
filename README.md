# ovos-picroft

Run ovos on top of RaspberryPiOS

Check out the docs for information on how to install manually

## Purpose of this guide

This guide was originally designed for a headless, (No GUI) Raspberry Pi 3.  The RPi3 does not have the umph required to reliably run [ovos-shell](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-shell), hence "headless".  There is not an image avaliable at this point in time that works with this hardware(RPi3), so this was constructed.  This guide <strong>DOES NOT</strong> produce the same experince as the official images do.  This just creates a minimal install, that the user can then expand to thier own personal needs.

There is an image for this setup on the drawing board, but has not yet been implemented.

Please, if any mistakes, including spelling mistakes are found, or if a more detailed explanation of a step is needed, open an [issue here](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-picroft/issues) and I will address it ASAP.
